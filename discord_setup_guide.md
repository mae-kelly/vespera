✅ **Real-time**: Instant notifications with zero delay

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create Discord Webhook

1. Go to your Discord server
2. Click **Server Settings** (gear icon next to server name)
3. Go to **Integrations** > **Webhooks**
4. Click **New Webhook**
5. Configure:
   - **Name**: `HFT Trading Bot`
   - **Channel**: Choose your trading alerts channel
   - **Avatar**: Upload a trading bot icon (optional)
6. Click **Copy Webhook URL**

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Add to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Discord Webhook (REQUIRED)
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1234567890/AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz

# Discord User ID for mentions (OPTIONAL)
DISCORD_USER_ID=123456789012345678
```

### 3. Get Your User ID (Optional - for mentions)

1. Enable **Developer Mode** in Discord:
   - User Settings > Advanced > Developer Mode (toggle on)
2. Right-click your username anywhere in Discord
3. Select **Copy ID**

   - Check for typos in webhook URL
   - Verify webhook wasn't deleted

2. **No Messages Appearing**
   - Check webhook channel permissions
   - Verify webhook is enabled
   - Test with validation script

3. **Mentions Not Working**
   - Enable Developer Mode in Discord
   - Copy correct User ID (18-digit number)
   - Ensure user is in the server

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Test all connections
./validate_env_connections.sh

# Test only Discord
python3 -c "
import os
from notifier import discord_notifier
success, msg = discord_notifier.test_connection()
print('✅ Success' if success else f'❌ Failed: {msg}')
"
```

## Security Notes

- Webhook URLs are sensitive - keep them private
- Don't share webhook URLs in public channels
- Regenerate webhook if compromised
- Use private Discord servers for trading alerts

Your Discord integration is now more powerful and reliable than Telegram! 🚀
